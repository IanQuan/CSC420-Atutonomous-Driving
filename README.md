# Road Segmentation with U-Net

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a road segmentation model tailored for autonomous driving applications. The model uses the U-Net architecture to segment roads from stereo images effectively, enhancing the navigational capabilities of autonomous vehicles.


## Model Details
- **Architecture**: U-Net
- **Purpose**: Road segmentation
- **Features**: Integration of depth maps with road ground truth to enhance segmentation accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite
- **Description**: A widely recognized dataset comprising high-resolution stereo image pairs designed for autonomous driving research, capturing detailed urban environment data.
- **Reference**: [KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)
